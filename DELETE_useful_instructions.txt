Run a Local Web Server for Development

If you are building a web app, you will find that some parts of the Firebase JavaScript SDK require that your web app be served from a server rather than from the local filesystem. You can use the Firebase CLI to run a local server like this:

$ npm install -g firebase-tools
$ firebase init
$ firebase serve



//install firebase
npm install firebase --save

//open emulators
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android

react-native log-android
